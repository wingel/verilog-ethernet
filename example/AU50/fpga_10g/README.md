# Verilog Ethernet Alveo U50 Example Design

## Introduction

This example design targets the Xilinx Alveo U50 FPGA board.

The design by default listens to UDP port 1234 at IP address 192.168.1.128 and
will echo back any packets received.  The design will also respond correctly
to ARP requests.  

*  FPGA: xcu50-fsvh2104-2-e
*  PHY: 10G BASE-R PHY IP core and internal GTY transceiver

## How to build

Run make to build.  Ensure that the Xilinx Vivado toolchain components are
in PATH.  

## How to test

Run make program to program the Alveo U50 board with Vivado.  Then run
netcat -u 192.168.1.128 1234 to open a UDP connection to port 1234.  Any text
entered into netcat will be echoed back after pressing enter.
